* Streetlamp

Streetlamp is a control panel and manager for legacy LAMP websites.  None of us want to bother with them anymore, but sometimes you just can't help it.  Streetlamp makes dealing with legacy "Apache, MySQL and PHP" websites on Linux a little less painful with a RESTful API, command line utility and web-based control panel options.  As a bonus, Nginx and MariaDB are supported by default.
